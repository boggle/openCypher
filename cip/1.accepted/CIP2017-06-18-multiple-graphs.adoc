== Motivation

Cypher today is a query language for property graphs that provides access to a single, global, implicit graph in order to extract, transform, and return tabular data that is derived from it.
While such returned tabular data may include graph entities (such as nodes and relationships), in essence Cypher as a language is not closed under graphs and as a consequence, Cypher queries are not yet (graph) compositional.

However it seems desirable that a language for property graphs should not only enable querying and updating a selected graph but should also support the construction and transformation of multiple graphs, ideally by utilizing a mechanism for incremental query composition.

Furthermore, adding support for working with multiple graphs has recently been identified as a frequently requested feature:

* It enables the dynamic construction of graph views (e.g. for access control)
* It allows reasoning over multiple versions of the same graph (e.g. comparing daily snapshots)
* It provides an effective grouping mechanism for naturally-partitioned data (e.g. per-continent graph)
* It is useful for combining data from disparate data sources in one system (e.g. in federation and data integration scenarios)
* It fits the paradigm of prominent analytical big-data processing systems (e.g. Apache Spark)
* It mirrors mathematical graph theory where working with multiple graphs is common

== Multiple property graphs model

The data model used here is called the *multiple property graphs data model*.
It extends the original https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/blob/master/docs/property-graph-model.adoc[*property graph model*] with the notion of multiple graphs as outlined in the following subsections.

=== Model instance

_Definition_: A *multiple property graphs model instance* is a set of property graphs.

=== Basic definitions

_Definition_: A *label* is a symbolic string that is used for classifying nodes.

_Definition_: A *relationship type* is a symbolic string that is used for classifying relationships.

_Definition_: A *property* is a tuple consisting of a named *property key* and a *property value*.

=== Model elements

_Term_: The constituents of an instance of the multiple property graphs model are called its *model elements*.

_Definition_: An *identity* is a value that is used to identify individual model elements and to distinguish between multiple model elements from the same context.
Identities must not be `NULL` and must not be nested values that contain `NULL`.
Identities must not be model elements and must not be nested values that contain model elements.

_Term_: The constituents of a model element (including its identity) are called its *content*.

_Definition_: A *(property) graph* has a *graph identity* that uniquely identifies the graph and at least allows to distinguish it from other graphs in the same instance of the multiple property graph  model.
A property graph further consists of a set of nodes and a set of relationships that connect the nodes of the property graph.
Each property graph is contained in exactly one instance of the multiple property graphs data model.

Graphs may be either immutable or updatable.
This is not considered to be part of the content of the graph.

_Definition_: A *node* has a *node identity* that uniquely identifies the node and at least allows to distinguish it from other nodes that are contained in the same property graph.
A node further consists of a set of zero or more labels and zero or more properties with mutually different property keys.
Each node is contained in exactly one property graph.

_Definition_: A *relationship* has a *relationship identity* that uniquely identifies the relationship and at least allows to distinguish it from other relationships that are contained in the same property graph.
A relationship further consists of a *start node*, an *end node*, and exactly one relationship type, and zero or more properties with mutually different property keys.
Each relationship is contained in exactly one property graph and its start node and its end node are both contained in the same property graph as the relationship.

_Term_: Both nodes and relationships are called *entities*.

=== Reflective functions

The identities of model elements may be obtained using the following reflective functions:

The `graph(e)` function returns the *graph identity* of the graph that contains an entity `e`.

The `id(n)` function returns the *node identity* of a node `n`.

The `id(r)` function returns the *relationship identity* of a relationship `r`.



== Query processing

_Definition_: A *source program* is a piece of text that is intended to be both a syntatically valid term according to the root production rule of the grammar of the Cypher property graph query language and also a semantically valid term according to the semantic rules of the Cypher property graph query language.

_Definition_: A *query processor* is a query processing service that executes a source program  on behalf of a *client*  and provides the client with the *execution result* that describes the outcome of executing the source program.

=== Catalog

Every query processor maintains exactly one *catalog*.

_Definition_: A _catalog_ is a mapping from *fully qualified graph names* to graph references.
Multiple entries in the catalog may refer to the same graph.

A fully qualified graph name should use the syntax for dotted variable identifiers and consists of an optional *graph namespace*, and a mandatory *graph name*.

Note:: In practice, a query processor might have a catalog shared by all users, or provide a different catalog for each user.
This is not considered here based on the simplifying assumption that all client requests are made by the same user.

=== Statements

_Definition_: A *statement* is a source program that is a syntatically valid term according to the root production rule of the grammar of the Cypher property graph query language.

_Definition_: A *semantically valid statement* is a statement that is valid according to the semantic rules of the Cypher property graph query language.

A statement may either be a *single statement* or a *statement chain*.

_Definition_: A _single statement_ is one of

 * reading query (a query that reads and returns data)
 * updating query (a query that reads, updates, and returns data)
 * updating command (a query that reads and updates data but returns no data)
 * schema command (a query that only updates the data schema)
 * catalog command (a query that only updates the catalog)

Single statements in turn consist of a chain of one ore more clauses which each may be further qualified by clause arguments, sub-clauses and sub-clause arguments.

_Definition_: A _statement chain_ is a single statement followed by a semicolon followed by another statement.

=== Execution of client requests

==== Client requests

_Definition_: A source program together with all required parameters is called a *client request*.

==== Execution results

_Definition_: The result of executing a client request is called an *execution result*.
An execution result is one of

* a *tabular result*, i.e. a collection of records where each record has the exact same set of named fields.
Tabular results may contain duplicate results and may optionally be ordered
* a *graph result*, i.e. the contents of a graph as described by its set of nodes and relationships
* an *execution error*, i.e. a message describing the reason that prevented the query processor from executing the statement correctly

==== Request execution

Clients interact with the query processor by submitting a client request.
The source program is then executed by the query processor and an execution result is returned to the client for consumption.
An error is raised if the client request does not contain a semantically valid statement.

==== Execution of statement chains

Statement chains are executed by executing all contained single statements in the order given.
If execution of any contained single statement fails with an error, the execution of the whole statement fails with the same error.
Otherwise, the query processor discards all intermediary results produced by a statement chain and only returns the execution result for the last single statement.

==== Identity validity

Identities are guaranteed to be valid for the duration of executing a statement and consuming its result.

Implementations may choose to guarantee the validity of identities across multiple client requests.

Note:: The same identity value might reference different model elements in results from executing different statements.

==== Property value validity

Implementations may choose to support the use of any Cypher value as a valid property value except for values that either are or contain model elements.
Additionally, property values must not be `NULL`.

An error is raised the client request attempts to set a property to an invalid value.

Setting the property of an entity to `NULL` is treated as if the property would have been removed.


==== Returning graph model elements

If an execution result that is returned _to the client_ contains a graph model element, this graph model element is returned together with its content at the time of terminating the query (i.e. the client always receives the current content of all graph model elements).

Note:: Additionally, a result may contain implementation specific metadata like a summary of performed update activity (e.g. the number of nodes created) or a detailed query plan.


=== Working graph

Most Cypher clauses operate within the context of a *working graph*, by reading or updating it.

_Definition_: The _working graph_ is a reference to a graph that is maintained during statement execution.
The working graph is optional and may be unset at the start of executing a statement.

The working graph may either reference a graph in the catalog or may reference a graph that was dynamically constructed during statement execution.

A query processor may choose to establish an *initial working graph* for each executed statement.
The details of this are left to implementations.

If a query processor has not established an initial working graph (i.e. the working graph is unset) and the statement fails to set a working graph explicitly before attempting to operate on the working graph, an error is raised.



== Graph operations in queries

The working graph may be operated on in the following ways:

* The working graph can be changed by selecting a graph that is known by the catalog.
* The working graph may be returned as a query result
* The working graph can be changed by constructing a new graph
* The working graph can be changed by constructing a disjoint graph union

=== Selecting the working graph from the catalog for querying

The working graph may be changed for all subsequent querying clauses using:

[source, cypher]
----
FROM [GRAPH] < graph-name >
----

`<graph-name>` is expected to be the name of a graph in the catalog.

If `<graph-name>` is not the name of a graph in the catalog, an error is raised.

If is an error to perform an updating operation on a working graph that was introduced using `FROM GRAPH`.

=== Selecting the working graph from the catalog for updating

The working graph may be changed for all subsequent querying and updating clauses using:

[source, cypher]
----
EDIT [GRAPH] < graph-name >
----

`<graph-name>` is expected to be the name of a graph in the catalog.

If `<graph-name>` is not the name of a graph in the catalog, an error is raised.

If is an error to not perform at least a single updating operation on a working graph that was introduced using `EDIT GRAPH`.

=== Returning a graph result

The working graph may be returned as a query result using:

[source, cypher]
----
RETURN GRAPH
----

Additionally, the following syntactic form is supported for selecting the working graph from the catalog and returning it at the same time:

[source, cypher]
----
RETURN GRAPH < graph-name >
----

Graphs are always returned by reference to the caller.
This does not affect the rules on returning graph model elements together with a snapshot of their content to the client.

=== Constructing a graph

Graph construction dynamically constructs a new working graph in a query in order to query it, store it in the catalog, or return it to the client.

Graph construction is the dual operation to graph matching: While graph matching extracts pattern instances into variable bindings from the working graph, graph construction builds a new working graph from variable bindings.

All nodes and relationships in the newly constructed graph have new entity identities and are different from any previously matched entities.

The general form of graph construction is:

[source, cypher]
----
CONSTRUCT
  [ON GRAPH]
  [ON < graph-name-list >]
  [CLONE < cloned-entities >]
  [NEW < patterns >]
  [YIELD < return-items >]
----

Graph construction supports sub-clauses for *cloning of existing entities*, the *addition of new entities*, and *yielding of result variable bindings*.

At least either the `ON` sub-clause, the `CLONE` sub-clause, or the `NEW` sub-clause must be present in `CONSTRUCT`.

A statement may not end in a `CONSTRUCT` clause (invalid syntax).

==== Newly constructed entities

The `NEW <patterns>` sub-clause may be used to construct new nodes and relationships in the constructed graph in the same way as the `CREATE` clause allows to create new nodes and relationships in existing graphs.

`NEW` creates exactly one pattern instance in the new graph for each input record.

==== Cloned entities

In order to reconstruct subgraph structures from other graphs in the new graph, `CONSTRUCT` supports the addition of *cloned entities* in the new graph.

Cloning ensures that exactly one (representative) cloned entity is created in the new graph for a given cloned entity.
In particular, if the same input entity is cloned multiple times this will still only create one cloned entity in the new graph.
Cloning a relationship implicitly clones its start node and its end node.

The `ON GRAPH` sub-clause may be used to clone all nodes and relationships from the working graph into the new graph.

The `ON < graph-name-list >` sub-clause may be used to clone all nodes and relationships from the given graphs in the catalog into the new graph.

The `CLONE < return-items >` sub-clause may be used to clone entities and bind the cloned entities to new variable names or shadow already bound variables.
`CLONE` constructs cloned entities for each input record subject to the following rules:

 * Cloning a single, already bound variable rebinds the variable. In other words `CLONE a` is interpreted as `CLONE a AS a`.
 * Cloning a nested value (like a path) implicitly clones all contained nodes and relationships

==== Yielding result variable bindings

The `YIELD *|<return-items>|NONE` sub-clause may be used to preserve the current record cardinality and optionally either preserve or shadow input variable bindings as well as introduce new variable bindings.

`YIELD *` may be used to yield the variable bindings for all cloned and newly created entities.
This will preserve the current record cardinality but may shadow input variable bindings as well as introduce new variable bindings.

`YIELD <return-items>` may be used to yield variable bindings for explicitly selected cloned and newly created entities.
This will preserve the current record cardinality but may shadow input variable bindings as well as introduce new variable bindings.

`YIELD NONE` may be used to yield no additional variable bindings.
This will preserve the current record cardinality and all input variable bindings.


==== Not yielding result variable bindings

If a `CONSTRUCT` clause is not ending in a `YIELD` sub-clause, the current record cardinality and all input variable bindings are dropped.
The next clause then proceeds in the newly constructed working graph on a single record with no fields.

=== Disjoint graph union

The disjoint graph union of two graphs may be computed using the following syntax:

[source, cypher]
----
< query-1 >
RETURN GRAPH
UNION ALL
< query-2 >
RETURN GRAPH
----

The resulting union graph consists of clones of all entities from the two input graphs.

== Creating and administrating graphs in the catalog

Creating a new graph in the catalog is done using the new DDL command `CREATE GRAPH`. `CREATE GRAPH` can be used without a subquery, which results in creating a new graph without any content.
If CREATE GRAPH is followed by a subquery that returns a graph

//
//
// === Graph Addressing
//
// Graphs do not expose an identity in the same way that nodes or relationships do.
//
// Graphs may be made addressable through other means by a conforming implementation, e.g. through exposing the graph via a _graph URL_ for referencing and loading it.
// The details regarding the format and choice of graph URLs is beyond the scope of this proposal.
//
// A graph is considered to have been deleted if it is no longer registered under a graph URL and no other reference to it is retained, e.g. from a running query.
//
// == Background: Single Graph Execution Model
//
// Before detailing the foundational changes proposed by this CIP, we will define some basic terms and concepts for describing the state that is manipulated by Cypher's current single graph execution model.
//
// A Cypher query currently takes a set of parameters as input, queries a single, global, implicit property graph, potentially updates it, and finally returns tabular data derived from it.
// Query parameters are conceptually thought to be inlined before the start of query execution.
// Therefore the *session context* of a whole Cypher query is a single, global, implicit property graph.
//
// Each sequence of clauses (sometimes called a *pipeline*) optionally operates on this single implicit graph and takes a single table input in order to produce a new single table output.
// Furthermore, Cypher supports query combinator clauses like `UNION` and `UNION ALL` for merging two pipelines into a single pipeline.
// Therefore the *query context* that conceptually is passed between clauses in the single graph execution model is simply a single table.
//
// With this terminology in place, execution of a parameterized Cypher query in the single graph execution model can be described as executing within (and operating on) a given session context and an initial query context and finally returning the query context produced as output for the final `RETURN` clause.
//
// NOTE: This formulation is introduced to describe a high-level model for the execution of queries; a real world implementation is free to choose any other internal representation (e.g. based on an algebra) as long as it does not violate the specified semantics.
//
// == Proposal: Multiple Graphs Execution Model
//
// In the single graph execution model, tabular data serves as the basis of iteration while the single implicit global graph serves as the basis of graph matching and graph manipulation.
//
// This section introduces the *multiple graphs execution model* as an evolution of the single graph execution model that enables the addition of features to the language for working with multiple graphs, i.e. it changes the basis of graph matching and graph manipulation.
//
// This CIP proposes the adoption of the multiple graphs execution model by Cypher and to execute existing, single graph queries under this model as outlined below.
//
// === Model definition
//
// This CIP proposes redefining the *session context* to be
//
// * a set of graphs in the multiple graphs execution model
// * a special graph drawn from this set that is called the *default graph*
//
// This CIP proposes redefining the *query context* to be
//
// * a set of named graphs from the *session context*
// * *tabular data*, i.e. a potentially ordered bag of records, each having the same fixed set of fields
// * a special graph drawn from the *session context* that is called the *source graph*
// * a special graph drawn from the *session context* that is called the *target graph*
//
// These redefinitions comprise the multiple graphs execution model.
// A parameterized Cypher query under this model can _also_ be described as executing within (and operating on) a given session context and starting from an initial query context and finally returning the query context produced as output for the final `RETURN` clause.
//
// As a consequence of adopting the new multiple graphs execution model, the semantics of each clause need to be (re-)defined as to how the execution of the clause transforms all given input query contexts into an output query context.
// This CIP preserves all existing semantics by defining how to simulate the single graph execution model in the multiple graphs execution model as outlined below.
//
// === Query composition
//
// The multiple graphs execution model provides a natural way for the sequential composition of queries:
//
// A query `Q1` whose output signature is (in terms of provided bindings) an acceptable input signature for another query `Q2` may be composed sequentially with `Q2` into a new query `Q3` that first runs `Q1` on the initial query context, next runs `Q2` on the query context returned by `Q1`, and finally returns the query context returned by `Q2`.
//
// This homogenous query composition is enabled by using a uniform query context that is passed between clauses.
//
// === Query combinators
//
// Query combinators only need to handle tabular query contexts in the single graph execution model.
//
// For the multiple property graphs execution model, it is necessary to define how query combinators combine the query contexts of all child queries into a new result query context (c.f. query composition).
//
// This CIP proposes that the multi-arm query combinators `UNION` (and `UNION ALL` respectively) combine their contexts according to the following rules:
//
// * Tabular data is combined as today, i.e. the tabular result is either a concatenation (`UNION ALL` case) or a distinct union (`UNION` case) of the tabular data from both arms
// *  All graphs from both arms are returned; if both arms return a graph with the same name, then the union of those graphs is returned under that shared name
// * If both queries have specified a graph with the same name as their current source graph, then the union of those source graphs under that name again becomes the source graph for further processing.
// Otherwise, the default graph becomes the source graph for further processing.
// * If both queries have specified a graph with the same name as their current target graph, then the union of those target graphs under that name again becomes the target graph for further processing.
// Otherwise, the default graph becomes the target graph for further processing.
//
// === Expression evaluation
//
// Expressions are generally evaluated using the source graph of the current query context.
//
// === Updating queries
//
// This CIP proposes the following update semantics for Cypher with support for multiple graphs:
//
// * All updating clauses read from the source graph and write to the target graph of their current query context.
//   More concretely:
//   ** Entities are always created in, updated in, and deleted from the currently provided target graph.
//   ** Variables used in `CREATE` and `MERGE` that have been previously bound will cause the bound entity to be added to the target graph of the current query context.
//   ** `MERGE` uses the source graph to find existing entities.
//   ** Deleting an entity only affects the provided target graph of the current query context.
// * Updating queries behave as if they would end in `RETURN - GRAPHS -` (this syntax is introduced below).
// * Semantically, all effects of an updating clause must be made visible before proceeding with the execution of the next clause.
// In other words, a conforming implementation must ensure that a later clause always sees the complete set of updates of a preceding updating clause.
//
// This CIP proposes allowing `MERGE` to be followed by a non-empty, comma-separated list of bound variables for explicitly adding entities to the target graph.
//
// === Simulating the single graph execution model
//
// Execution under the single graph execution model can be simulated in the multiple graphs execution model by executing the query in an session context that uses the single graph as the default graph, and by running it on an empty initial query context.
//
// == Proposal: Multiple Graphs Syntax
//
// This CIP first proposes new syntactical concepts before proceeding to add new and extend existing clauses.
//
// === Named graphs
//
// Here we introduce the notion of _named graphs_.
// The name of a graph is used to reference the graph in the query context.
// Graph names are denoted here with `<graph-name>`, and use the same syntax as normal variables.
//
// NOTE: Graph names live in the same namespace as variables, thus it is an error to define a graph with a name of a previously existing variable, and vice versa.
//
// ==== Graph references and aliases
//
// An explicit reference to a graph is simply the name of the graph.
// A _graph alias_ is a graph reference optionally followed by `AS <graph-name>`, denoted here as `<graph-alias>`.
// A _graph alias list_ is a comma-separated list of graph aliases, denoted here as `<graph-alias-list>`.
//
// ==== Resolving external graphs
//
// Graphs are loaded into the query context by resolving a given graph URL in _graph URL subclause_.
// Graph URL subclauses are on the form `AT <graph-url>` or `TO <graph-url>`, where the exact shape and form of `<graph-url>` lies outside the scope of this CIP.
// However, this CIP proposes that a graph URL should be given as either a string literal or a query parameter, in order to give a query planner static knowledge of loaded graphs, and allowing queries to be parametrised on its input and output graphs.
//
// ==== Graph definitions
//
// Let `<graph-def>` denote a _graph definition_, which is a construct used to introduce additional named graphs.
//
// There are three kinds of graph definitions:
//
// * _new_ graph definitions, denoted by `<new-graph-def>`,
// * _collecting_ graph definitions, denoted by `<collect-graph-def>`,
// * _aliasing_ graph definitions, denoted by `<alias-graph-def>`.
//
// Many graph definitions allow an optional graph url subclause, where optionality is denoted using `[]`.
//
// New graph definitions always introduce a new graph:
//
// * `NEW GRAPH <graph-name> [AT <graph-url]`: Defines an empty graph with name `<graph-name>`, optionally published at `<graph-url>`.
// * `COPY GRAPH <graph-name> FROM <graph-ref> [TO <graph-url>]`: Defines a copy of the graph given by `<graph-ref>` with name `<graph-name>`, optionally published at `<graph-url>`.
// A copied graph shares the same entities of its original.
// * `CLONE GRAPH <graph-name> FROM <graph-ref> [TO <graph-url>]`: Same as `COPY`, except entities are also copied instead of shared.
// * `GRAPH <graph-name> AT <graph-url>`: Defines a graph with name `<graph-name>` loaded from the given `<graph-url>`.
//
// Collecting graph definitions are on the form `GRAPH <graph-name> OF <match-pattern> [AT <graph-url>]` and defines a graph newly constructed from tabular input records by collecting all entities from bound variables and creating new entities for all unbound variables in the patterns given in `<match-pattern>`, optionally published at `<graph-url>`.
//
// Aliasing graph definitions `<alias-graph-def>` alias an existing graph under a new name:
//
// * `GRAPH <graph-alias> [AT <graph-url>]` (i.e. `GRAPH <graph-ref> AS <new-graph-name> [AT <graph-url>]`): A new alias for an existing graph, optionally published at `<graph-url>`.
// * `SOURCE GRAPH AS <new-graph-name> [AT <graph-url>]`: An alias for the current _source graph_.
// * `TARGET GRAPH AS <new-graph-name> [AT <graph-url>]`: An alias for the current _target graph_.
// * `DEFAULT GRAPH AS <new-graph-name> [AT <graph-url>]`: An alias for the current _default graph_.
//
// This CIP defines the notion of an optional graph definition `<opt-graph-def>` that does not provide a `<new-graph-name>` and does not contain a subclause of the form `[AT|TO] <graph-url>` for aliasing graph definitions.
//
// `GRAPH <match-pattern>` is proposed to be a shorthand for the valid optional graph definition of the form `GRAPH OF <match-pattern>`
//
// ==== Graph specifiers
//
// This CIP defines the notion of a graph specifier `<graph-spec>` to be either a `<graph-def>` or an `<opt-graph-def>`.
//
// === Introducing multiple graphs
//
// As a first language addition, this CIP proposes syntax for introducing graphs into the current query context:
//
// [source, cypher]
// ----
// FROM < graph-spec >
// INTO < graph-spec >
// ----
//
// ==== FROM clause: Change the source and the target graph
//
// This CIP proposes a new `FROM` clause to change both the source and the target graph of the current query context as described.
//
// ==== INTO clause: Change the target graph only
//
// This CIP proposes a new `INTO` clause to change the target graph of the current query context as described.
//
// === THEN clause: Discarding available tabular data
//
// This CIP additionally proposes a new `THEN` clause that may be used for passing on all named graphs while discarding all tabular data such that the tabular input for the following clause (or query respectively) becomes a single record without any fields.
//
// NOTE: This syntax may be used to indicate when the gradual construction of a named graph is finished since neither fields nor the cardinality of tabular data is preserved after this point.
//
// === Returning, aliasing, and selecting graphs
//
// This CIP proposes to extend both the `WITH` and the `RETURN` clauses with new syntax for controlling the set of available named graphs that should be passed on by the clause (or returned from the query respectively) by explicitly specifying all `<graph-return-items>`.
// The newly proposed syntax is:
//
// [source, cypher]
// ----
// WITH < return-items > < graph-return-items >
// WITH < graph-return-items >
// RETURN < return-items > < graph-return-items >
// WITH < graph-return-items >
// ----
//
// This CIP defines that `<graph-return-items>` is either just `GRAPHS -` for indicating that all named graphs currently in scope are to be discarded or a space-separated list of:
//
// *  `<graph-def>`: to indicate that the defined graph is to be passed on,
// * `GRAPHS *`: to indicate that all named graphs currently in scope are to be passed on,
// * `GRAPHS <graph-alias-list>`: to indicate that all explicitly listed named graphs are to be passed on.
//
// Both `WITH ... GRAPHS ...` and `RETURN ... GRAPHS ...` will pass on (or return respectively) exactly the set of graphs described by `<graph-return-items>`.
//
// `GRAPHS *, <graph-alias-list>` is proposed to be a shorthand for `GRAPHS * GRAPHS <graph-alias-list>`.
// This forms indicates that all named graphs currently in scope together with any additionally introduced named graphs from `<graph-alias-list>` are to be passed on.
// It is an error if this leads to shadowing of already bound named graphs by newly introduced named graphs.
// Similarly, `GRAPHS <graph-alias-list>, *` is proposed to be a shorthand for `GRAPHS <graph-alias-list> GRAPHS *`.
//
// The order of named graphs inherently given by `<graph-return-items>` is otherwise semantically insignificant.
// However it is recommended that conforming implementations preserve this order at least in programmatic output operations (e.g. a textual display of the list of returned graphs).
// This in essence mirrors the semantics for tabular data returned by Cypher.
//
// Furthermore, this CIP proposes the following shorthands:
//
// * `WITH <return-items>` is to be a shorthand for `WITH <return-items> GRAPHS *`
// * `WITH <graph-return-items>` is to be a shorthand for `THEN WITH - <graph-return-items>`
// * `RETURN <return-items>` is to be a shorthand for `RETURN <return-items> GRAPHS -`
// * `RETURN <graph-return-items>` is to be a shorthand for `THEN RETURN - <graph-return-items>`
//
// === Selecting context graphs from projections
//
// It is proposed that at most once either the `<new-graph-name>` of a named graph described by a `<graph-return-item>`  may be prefixed with the keyword `SOURCE` or the keyword `GRAPH` in a `<graph-def>` should be replaced with `SOURCE GRAPH` to indicate that the described graph should be set as new source and target graph of the next clause.
//
// It is proposed that a `<graph-return-item>` of the form `<opt-graph-def>` is a shorthand for setting the new source graph and target graph of the next clause.
//
// It is proposed that at most once either the `<new-graph-name>` of a named graph described by a `<graph-return-item>`  may be prefixed with the keyword `TARGET` or the keyword `GRAPH` in a `<graph-def>` should be replaced with `TARGET GRAPH` to indicate that the described graph should be set as new target graph of the next clause.
//
// It is propsed that specifying a target graph this way overrides any specification of a source graph given in the same projection clause.
//
// === Query signature declarations
//
// Finally this CIP proposed using the `WITH` clause as the initial clause in a query for declaring all query inputs.
//
// It is proposed that using `WITH` as the initial clause in a query is to be called a *query input declaration* while the use of `RETURN` as the last clause is to be called a *query output declaration*.
//
// Query input declarations are subject to the following limitations:
//
// * All expected tabular input arguments must be given as simple variables
// * All expected graph input arguments should be given as graph return items for named graphs only
// * If the input query context provides additional, undeclared variables or graphs, those inputs are to be silently discarded
//
// A query that does not start with a query input declaration is assumed to start with `WITH - GRAPHS -`.

// [[data-integration-example]]
// === A complete example illustrating a data integration scenario
//
// Assume we have two graphs, *ActorsFilmsCities* and *Events*, each of which is contained in a separate location.
// This example will show how these two graphs can be integrated into a single graph.
//
// The *ActorsFilmsCities* graph models the following entities:
//
// * Actors and people fulfilling other roles in the film-industry.
// * Films in which they acted, or directed, or for which they wrote the soundtrack.
// * Cities in which they were born.
// * The relationships between family members and colleagues.
//
// Each node is labelled and contains one or two properties (where `YOB` stands for 'year of birth'), and each relationship of type `ACTED_IN` has a `charactername` property indicating the name of the character the relevant `Actor` played in the `Film`.
//
// image::opencypher-PersonActorCityFilm-graph.jpg[Graph,800,650]
//
// The other graph, *Events*, models information on events.
// Each event is linked to an event type by an `IS_A` relationship, to a year by an `IN_YEAR` relationship, and to a city by an `IN_CITY` relationship.
// For example, the _Battle of Britain_ event is classified as a _War Event_, occurred in the year _1940_, and took place in _London_.
//
// In contrast to the *ActorsFilmsCities* graph, *Events* contains no labels on any node, no properties on any relationship, and only a single `value` property on each node.
// *Events* can be considered to be a snapshot of data from an RDF graph, in the sense that every node has one and only one value; i.e. in contrast to a property graph, an RDF graph has properties on neither nodes nor relationships.
// (For easier visibility, we have coloured accordingly the cities and city-related relationships, event types and event-type relationships, and year and year-related relationships.)
//
// image::opencypher-Events-graph.jpg[Graph,800,600]
//
// The aims of the data integration exercise are twofold:
//
// * Create and persist to disk (for future use) a new graph, *PersonCityEvents*, containing an amalgamation of data from *ActorsFilmsCities* and *Events*.
// *PersonCityEvents* must contain all the event information from *Events*, and only `Person` nodes connected to `City` nodes from *ActorsFilmsCities*.
//
// * Create and return a temporary graph, *Temp-PersonCityCrimes*.
// *Temp-PersonCityCrimes* must contain a subset of the data from *PersonCityEvents*, consisting only of the criminal events, their associated `City` nodes, and `Person` nodes associated with the `City` nodes.
//
// ==== Step 1
//
// The first action to take in our data integration exercise is to set the source graph to *ActorsFilmsCities*, for which we need to provide the physical address:
//
// [source, cypher]
// ----
// FROM GRAPH ActorsFilmsCities AT 'graph://actors_films_cities...'
// ----
//
// Next, match all `Person` nodes who have a `BORN_IN` relationship to a `City`:
//
// [source, cypher]
// ----
// MATCH (p:Person)-[:BORN_IN]->(c:City)
// ----
//
// Create the new graph *PersonCityEvents*, persist it to _some-location_, and set it as the target graph:
//
// [source, cypher]
// ----
// INTO NEW GRAPH PersonCityEvents AT 'some-location'
// ----
//
// Write the subgraph induced by the `MATCH` clause above into *PersonCityEvents*:
//
// [source, cypher]
// ----
// MERGE (p:Person {name: p.name, YOB: p.YOB})
// MERGE (c:City {name: c.name})
// MERGE (p)-[:BORN_IN]->(c)
// ----
//
// Putting all these statements together, we get:
//
// ._Query sequence for Step 1_:
// [source, cypher]
// ----
// FROM GRAPH ActorsFilmsCities AT 'graph://actors_films_cities...'
// MATCH (p:Person)-[:BORN_IN]->(c:City)
// INTO NEW GRAPH PersonCityEvents AT 'some-location'
// MERGE (p:Person {name: p.name, YOB: p.YOB})
// MERGE (c:City {name: c.name})
// MERGE (p)-[:BORN_IN]->(c)
//
// // Discard all tabular data and cardinality
// WITH GRAPHS *
// ----
//
// At this stage, *PersonCityEvents* is given by:
//
// image::opencypher-PersonCity-graph.jpg[Graph,600,400]
//
// ==== Step 2
//
// The next stage in the pipeline is to add the events information from *Events* to *PersonCityEvents*.
//
// Firstly, the source graph is set to *Events*, for which we need to provide the physical address:
//
// [source, cypher]
// ----
// FROM GRAPH Events AT 'graph://events...'
// ----
//
// At this point, the *Events* graph is in scope.
//
// All the events information -- the event itself, its type, the year in which it occurred, and the city in which it took place -- is matched:
//
// [source, cypher]
// ----
// MATCH (c)<-[:IN_CITY]-(e)-[:IN_YEAR]->(y),
//       (e)-[:IS_A]->(et {value: 'Criminal Event'})
//
// // Do matches for all other event types: Public Event, War Event....
// ...
// ----
//
// The target graph is set to the *PersonCityEvents* graph (created earlier):
//
// [source, cypher]
// ----
// INTO GRAPH PersonCityEvents
// ----
//
// Using the results from the `MATCH` clause, create a subgraph with more intelligible semantics through the transformation of the events information into a less verbose form through greater use of node-level properties.
//  Write the subgraph to *PersonCityEvents*.
//
// [source, cypher]
// ----
// MERGE (c:City {name: c.value})
// MERGE (e {title: e.value, year: y.value})
// MERGE (e)-[:HAPPENED_IN]->(c)
// SET e :WarEvent
//
// // Do for all remaining event types
// ...
// ----
//
// Putting all these statements together, we get:
//
// ._Query sequence for Step 2_:
// [source, cypher]
// ----
// FROM GRAPH Events AT 'graph://events...'
// MATCH (c)<-[:IN_CITY]-(e)-[:IN_YEAR]->(y),
//       (e)-[:IS_A]->(et {value: 'Criminal Event'})
//
// // Do matches for all other event types: Public Event, War Event....

// SET e :WarEvent
//
// // Do for all remaining event types
// ...
//
// // Discard all tabular data and cardinality
// WITH GRAPHS *
// ----
//
// *PersonCityEvents* now contains the following data:
//
// image::opencypher-PersonCityEvents-graph.jpg[Graph,800,700]
//
// ==== Step 3
//
// The last step in the data integration pipeline is the creation of a new, temporary graph, *Temp-PersonCityCrimes*, which is to be populated with the subgraph of all the criminal events and associated nodes from *PersonCityEvents*.
//
// Set *PersonCityEvents* to be in scope:
//
// [source, cypher]
// ----
// FROM GRAPH PersonCityEvents
// ----
//
// Next, obtain the subgraph of all criminal events -- i.e. nodes labelled with `CriminalEvent` -- and their associated `City` nodes, and `Person` nodes associated with the `City` nodes:
//
// [source, cypher]
// ----
// MATCH (ce:CriminalEvent)-[:HAPPENED_IN]->(c:City)<-[:BORN_IN]-(p:Person)
// ----
//
// Create the new, temporary graph *Temp-PersonCityCrimes*, and set it as the target graph:

//
// [source, cypher]

// MERGE (p:Person {name: p.name, YOB: p.YOB})
// MERGE (c:City {name: c.name})
// MERGE (ce:CriminalEvent {title: ce.title, year: ce.year})
// MERGE (p)-[:BORN_IN]->(c)
// MERGE (ce)-[:HAPPENED_IN]->(c)
// ----
//
// Putting all these statements together, we get:

// ._Query sequence for Step 3_:

// [[data-aggregation-example]]
// === Using a pipeline to perform aggregations and return tabular data and graphs
//
// This example shows how to aggregate detailed sales data within a graph -- in effect, performing a 'roll-up' -- in order to obtain a high-level summarized view of the data, stored and returned in another graph, as well as returning an even higher-level view as an executive report.
// The summarized graph may be used to draw further high-level reports, but may also be used to undertake 'drill-down' actions by probing into the graph to extract more detailed information.
//
// Assume we have the graph *SalesDetail*, representing the sale of products in stores across various regions:
//
// image::opencypher-SalesDetail-graph.jpg[Graph,800,700]
//
// This models the following entities:
//
// * Regions may have many stores.
// * Stores:
// ** A store is identified by a unique `code`.
// ** A store is contained in exactly one region.
// ** A store may have multiple orders.
// * Products:
// ** A product is identified by a unique `code`.
// ** A product has a `RRP` property (Recommended Retail Price).
// ** A product may appear in one or more orders as a product _item_.
// * Sales orders:
// ** An order is identified by a unique order number, given by `num`.
// ** The `YYYYMM` property represents the year and month portion of the date of the order.
// ** An order is associated with exactly one store and contains one or more product items, representing the fact that the product item was sold in the store and is a part of the order.
// ** The relationship of between an order and a product contains the following properties:
// *** `soldPrice`: the price at which the product item was actually sold (usually lower than the product's RRP).
// *** `numItemsSold`: the number of the actual product items sold in the order.
//
// The following pipeline will create a summarized view of this data, and store it in a new summary graph called *SalesSummary*.
//
// We begin by referencing the *SalesDetail* graph, and matching on all products in all orders for all stores in all regions.
//
// [source, cypher]
// ----
// FROM GRAPH SalesDetail AT ‘graph://...’
// MATCH (p:Product)-[r:IN]->(o:Order)<-[HAS]-(s:Store)-[:IN]->(reg:Region)

== Interaction with existing features

This proposal is far reaching as it changes both the property graph model and the execution model of the language.

However, the change has been carefully designed to not change the semantics of existing queries.

== Alternatives

The scope of this CIP could be reduced by not separating between the source and target graph.

== What others do

SPARQL only provides basic facilities for returning graphs using `CONSTRUCT`.

Neither Gremlin nor PGQL have developed facilities for the direct construction and manipulation of graphs.

== Benefits to this proposal

Cypher is evolved to become a query language that is properly closed under graphs.

== Caveats to this proposal

This is a fundamental and large change to the language whose long-term consequences are difficult to assess.
